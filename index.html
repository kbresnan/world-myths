            <h2 class="intro-title">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">A myth is a traditional story that is usually created to explain the mysteries of the world at a certain point in time. Technically, this word stems from the Greek word mythos or “story”. Typically, myths originated at a time in which philosophy, science, and technology were not as prominent, accurate, and precise, so in order to understand certain phenomena, and also, perhaps, to bring comfort to people, mythological tales were developed. <p>&nbsp;</p>There are three essential categories that most myths can be grouped into: aetiological (etiological) myths, historical myths, and psychological myths. Aetiological myths (from the Greek word aetion or “reason”) center around explaining why something is or how it came to be that way. To be even more specific, there are three main types of aetiological myths. A natural aetiological myth, which explains an aspect of nature, an etymological myth, which explains the origin of a certain word, and a religious aetiological myth, which explains the emergence of a religious ritual. Historical myths retell a true, past event, but elevate it by adding supernatural elements, or simply giving it a greater meaning. Psychological myths focus on a hero's journey, which incorporates people's psychological need to balance their external and internal worlds. These tales generally include a hero/heroine embarking on an eye-opening adventure, where they discover their true identity while also somehow resolving a significant external conflict. Psychological myths may also clarify why we feel the way we do and why we should act a certain way. Psychological myths stand out from other types of myths because they have the ability to connect with people on a personal level. <p>&nbsp;</p>Most myths can be split into these three groups, but many can be put into more than one category or overlap. Myths are interesting because while many myths share main aspects, explanations, and messages, they are relayed in a variety of ways and have subtle differences that make them all unique and especially captivating. Myths also can be interpreted in countless contrasting ways. A particular characteristic of myths that can be unraveled into numerous original ideas is symbols. Symbols can be taken in a multitude of senses and at differing lengths, so deciphering the true meaning(s) of a symbol is a thoughtful, debatable process. In addition to being compelling, myths are immensely crucial to culture. Mythological tales are filled with wisdom and insight but display, encourage, and spread it in an entertaining, but thought provoking manner. Myths identify and warn people of actions that may cause negative repercussions or call for consequences by providing an example through the fate of legendary characters. Myths also shed light on meaning and the deeper levels, workings, and desires at the root of human minds. Myths are a mirror of life and a gateway from the conscious mind and subconscious mind. Since everyone carries very similar root motivations and processes, myths unite, elevate, inspire, and offer a sense of protection and stabilization to a community. People never would have evolved as efficiently and sufficiently as they did without these connective and accumulative stories.

            <p class="culture-text">Each of these myths had a distinct purpose. "Hades and Persephone" was aetiological because it explained how the seasons came to be. The story of the Trojan War was historical because it tells of the events of the Trojan War, but elevates and excites it. The last myth, "Pandora's Box", is psychological. Psychological myths are important because they are the ones that focus on teaching a lesson, however subtle it may be. They are interesting because they are full of twists and a lot of the time can be left up to interpretation. The story of "Pandora's Box" is psychological mostly because it shows human emotion and traits that are negative, and shows why we feel those things; however, I also think it is psychological because of the metaphor about Hope. In the myth, Hope is left inside the box, which could be a metaphor about the hope we hold inside ourselves. Also, Hope was trapped inside the jar because Pandora was afraid to let it out after seeing all the evil, which parallels how people can be afraid to hope sometimes when they see how the world is so full of hatred and discord. Greek mythology is closely related to Roman mythology, but it also has connections to other cultures. "Hades and Persephone" does not have many connections outside of Greek mythology, but the Underworld as a whole is featured in other cultures, like Egyptian mythology and Mayan mythology, for example. The Trojan War has more connections because it was a real life event, but it still does not have many connections to historical myths from other cultures. One of the closest instances where this does occur is in Egyptian mythology, as it is mentioned that Pharaoh Ramases Ⅲ wanted to marry Helen of Troy when he first started ruling. "Pandora’s Box" could be compared to the idea of the two wolves from Cherokeean mythology (see Cherokeean Mythology), but the main difference between the two is that while the two wolves are balanced as good and evil, in "Pandora's Box", it is mostly evil, with the only good thing being Hope, which could imply that the Greeks took a more negative outlook on the world than the Cherokeean.

            <p class="culture-text">The first Egyptian myth, "Isis and the Seven Scorpions" was classified as aetiological because it explained the origin of the scorpion poultice, or salve, which became important for treating scorpion stings in Egypt before modern medicine was available. "The Treasure Thief" was historical because Ramases Ⅲ was a real pharaoh in Egypt. "Ani and the Book of the Dead" could have been aetiological, as Ani started the idea of mummies, and it could have been historical, since Ani was a real person; however, this myth was most prominently psychological. Not only did Ani have to embark on a "hero's journey", but also the myth outlined how people should act in life and in death in order to make it to the Afterlife. One thing I found interesting about this myth was that in reality, Ani was not a stereotypical "hero", and he only made it to the afterlife because he had help from his priests, for example, or immorally tricked his way through a lot of the obstacles, which could be a reflection of how desperation brings out selfishness and immorality in people. Most parallels that have to do with Egyptian mythology are usually related to Greek, Roman, or Norse mythology, but one main thing from Egyptian mythology that connects with many other cultures as well is the idea of Afterlife. Especially in the past, everyone wanted an idea of what happened after death. There were many theories about this, but the Egyptian one seems to be popular, as there are many ideas similar to it in other cultures.

            <p class="culture-text">The first myth, about the Tündérek was extremely aetiological because it explained both the Milky Way, and the origin of the water lily or water rose. The myth of the Blood Countess was historical because Elizabeth Báthory was a real person, but details of her murders have evolved over time, and many facts remain unknown. "Janos and Istvan" was psychological because it was a hero's (Janos) tale and showed how being kind paid off, which is an important lesson. These three Hungrian tales have interesting connections. Fairies are popular mythological creatures, and the Hungarian spin on them was similar to other culture's ancient interpretations. Other serial killers like Elizabeth Báthory lived and became legends in other cultures, but the Blood Countess is unique because she was a woman, and she had distinctive motivations. Today, there are many documentaries and books about the Blood Countess. The story of Janos and Istvan is extremely similar to the the Spanish tale "San Jorge" (see Spanish Mythology).</p>

            <p class="culture-text">"Branwen and her Bird" was aetiological because it told the ancient origins of Harlech Castle. "Merlin's Oak" was historical in its embellished discussion of the Carmarthen floods. The last myth, "Angelystor and Shôn ap Robert", could have been historical, but was better suited for the psychological category because it pointed out not making fun of things that one does not know, as it will come back later, just as it did for Shôn ap Robert when he died that year. The story of Branwen can be connected to Irish mythology as Branwen was married to an Irish king. Merlin was an unique case because most cultures feature an evil witch as a magician, but in Welsh mythology, Merlin was a benevolent wizard. Today, there are many books and movies centered around the adventurous and exciting life of Merlin. The story of Angelystor is reminiscent of witches, shamans, and fortune tellers from other cultures but is different because Angelystor is more mysterious. Overall, there are not many references to Welsh mythology in pop culture, but that could be slowly changing as more and more books are including Welsh culture in them. For example, a popular young adult by Maggie Stiefvater has Welsh mythology a central focus.</p>

            <p class="culture-text">The first myth, about San Jorge, is classified as aetiological because it explains why the people of Barcelona celebrate their original holiday as lively as they do. The second myth, which was about the Hall of the Abencerrages could be justified as aetiological, but the point of origin was weaker, and I ultimately classified it as historical because the Abencerrages were a real family who were killed at the banquet and were speculated to have been thrown in the fountains. "El Coco" was a psychological myth, mostly aimed at children, because it scares them into thinking they have to act a certain way. I found it interesting how such a dark story was being told to young kids, and even more fascinating that this aspect is shared in many cultures around the world. The story of San Jorge shares close ties with the story of Janos and Istvan, as both San Jorge and Janos slay a dragon, save a princess, and are considered to be heroes; however, the reason Janos and Istvan is psychological, whereas San Jorge is aetiological is that in Janos and Istvan, Istvan learns a lesson, whereas in San Jorge, no lesson is explored. "El Coco" is also paralleled in that it is said to be the Spanish version of the boogieman.

            <p class="culture-text">The first Mayan myth, which was about Xtabay and Utz-Colel, was aetiological because it explained the origins of the popular liquor Xtabentún, though it could also be considered psychological. The second myth, which was about Saiyawincoob, the dwarf of Uxmal, was grouped into the historical category. This could have been considered aetiological, as it explained the origins of many landmarks, but was classified as historical because there is proof that this happened, although the details of the people and the trials have been naturally altered over time. The last myth, which told the story of the twins Hunahpu and Xbalanque, was psychological because the twins got revenge on their cruel older brothers as part of their journey. One thing I found interesting about this myth was how at the end, when the grandmother was given three chances to bring her grandsons back, she could not do it because every time she saw them she would start laughing. I thought this was an interesting reflection of people's lack of self-control, and also sometimes how their senses can betray them, just as the grandmother's sense of sight betrayed her. Most of the parallels in Mayan mythology are in cultures like the Inca and Aztecs. In addition, there are not many instances in pop culture that relate to Mayan mythology; however, one thing I did find between Mayan mythology and other cultures has to do with Xtabay. I thought she was similar to the mythological figure of a siren, only she lived on land, whereas sirens live in the sea. Yet both have a similar idea; they seduce men to their deaths.

            <p class="culture-text">The myth discussing the first fire on Earth is aetiological. While it mainly explains how fire started on Earth, it also explains how the raven got black feathers, how the screech owl got red eyes, how the black racer snake became black and why it always darts around, and why the water spider has what looks like a tutsi bowl on its back. The second myth about the Cherokee rose was a historical myth. It told about the Trail of Tears, which was a real event, but added the supernatural aspect of how and why the Cherokee rose started growing, which is why it could be considered aetiological. The last myth, "The Two Wolves", was psychological because it discussed the common theme of good vs. evil. Cherokeean myths have the most parallels when compared to other Native American myths, but they also have relations to other cultures' mythology. For example, the story of the two wolves is similar to the idea of yin and yang from Chinese mythology, and even "Pandora's Box", from Greek mythology; however, one difference between the two is that the Cherokeean story suggests that humans have the power to affect the balance between good and evil.

            <p class="culture-text">The myth about the Aurora Borealis, also known as the Northern Lights, is aetiological because it explains what this phenomenon is. The second myth, the story of Sedna, is historical because Sedna was a real girl, but many details of her story are unclear. The third myth, about Kiviuq, was psychological because it told of a hero's journey, but also because it dealt with the idea of revenge, which I thought was really interesting especially because Kiviuq started out as a bully but grew to be a hero. The story of the Aurora Borealis was similar to the story of the Tündér from Hungarian mythology as they both deal with beings in the sky. Sedna reminds me of the mythological creature mermaids, as she is also half fish. Kiviuq is often compared to Odysseus. While there are not many movies on Inuit Mythology, there are a few books narrating Kiviuq's journey and many plays, as well.

            <p class="culture-text">The first myth, all about the trickster spider god Anansi, is aetiological because it explains how the art of storytelling began on Earth. The second myth, about the crocodiles of Paga, is historical because Nave was a real person. The last myth on whistling at night is psychological because it explains why people should not whistle at night. Interestingly enough, I was surprised to find that in a lot of cultures, there is a spider figure, who is usually a trickster like Anansi. While the crocodiles seem to be unique to Ghanaian mythology, there are ideas about afterlife where the soul enters another being, like an animal or plant, in other cultures, too. Whistling at night is actually a really common myth in a lot of cultures, like Japanese.

            <p class="culture-text">Princess Mi Nuong's story is aetiological because it explains the yearly monsoon season of Vietnam. The second Vietnamese myth surrounded dragons, and how they are important throughout the history of Vietnam, beginning with Lạc Long Quân and ending with the namings of locations in Vietnam. The last myth was about Tam, and was psychological because in the end, Tam, who was kind, got a happy ending whereas her stepmother and stepsister Cam, who were cruel, got a “bad ending”. One thing I thought was interesting about this myth is how many times Tam had to redo her work in order to finally get peace and happiness. Dragons are a very popular mythological creature, but the dragons of Vietnam are unique because while dragons in most other cultures are usually spewing fire, the Vietnamese dragons are actually water dragons. Another connection that includes Vietnamese mythology is how the legend of Tam is similar to the story of Cinderella, which can be found in many cultures around the world.

            <h2 class="conc-title">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="conc-text">Mythologies around the world prove that while variations develop based on different experiences, humans are widely similar. All myths had the same basis and structure, and there were many myths that shared similar themes or plot. For example, Janos the dragon slayer from Hungarian mythology was very similar to San Jorge from Spanish mythology. Also, Kiviuq, the hero from Inuit mythology is compared to Odysseus, the hero from Greek mythology. The two wolves from Cherokeean mythology are similar to Pandora's Box. Lastly, el Coco from Spanish mythology has similar traits to Xtabay from Mayan mythology. There were even some uncanny similarities between almost completely different myths like how in Greek mythology, when Demeter is searching for Persephone disguised as an old woman, she stops to rest at a village and a kind couple with an infant welcomes her. In return for their kindness, Demeter decides to make the infant immortal and does this by setting him in the fire each night until the mother finds out and Demeter sheds her disguise. Likewise, in Egyptian mythology, Isis is on the run from her brother Set disguised as an old woman and stops to rest at a village where a kind couple with an infant welcomes her. In return for their kindness, Isis decides to make the infant immortal and does this by setting him in the fire each night until the mother finds out and Isis sheds her disguise. Sound familiar? The most interesting part about this is that for the rest of those two myths, nothing else is even remotely similar. <p>&nbsp;</p>Carl Jung, who expanded depth psychology, developed an interesting theory for this reasoning. He suggested that humans have a “collective unconscious” or memory that evolves, but throughout the years still maintains a “psychic residue” of archetypes that are expressed as questions, and answered in patterns through myths. <p>&nbsp;</p>Although in general and at the root, people are similar, there are still many differences in the myths that make them unique, and reflect how each individual is unique as well. It is important to embrace these differences, while still acknowledging similarities. Three myths that have similar ideas, but differ on a deeper level are "El Coco", "Xtabay", and "Whistling at Night". For instance, because  of the story of el Coco, one can infer that many psychological myths from Spain are directed towards children, as el Coco steals and murders naughty children. To contrast, the legend of Xtabay shows that many psychological myths from the Mayans are directed towards adults, as Xtabay seduces and murders lustful men. Adding another level, the psychological myth about whistling at night from Ghana points towards that Ghanaian myths are directed to everyone, as the evils from that story trick and murder anyone they come across. Another pair of parallels are "Pandora's Box", from Greek mythology, and the "Two Wolves" from Cherokeean mythology. Both ideas discuss good vs. evil, but the main difference between the two is that while the two wolves are balanced as good and evil, in Pandora's box, it is mostly evil, with the only good being Hope. Also, in the Cherokeean wolf story, human actions affect the balance between good and evil, while in Pandora's Box, the evil affects human actions. <p>&nbsp;</p>One of the best cases for myths in showcasing our diversity is that even the exact same myth is never identical or repeated, because each time a myth is relayed, a twist, while however little, is added to the myth. This distortion can reflect an individual or society if uncovered. Myths set humans apart from other animals because of this potential to connect through similarities in the shared beliefs in myths, and ability to create stories that can evolve over time. One important characteristic of these myths are their job as connectors. Myths connect to many things such as religions, traditional rituals, and even other parts of daily life. For example, most Greek myths center around the Greek pantheon, or at least include a Greek god in them. Many people have trained themselves to be mindful about not whistling at night, probably because they heard the story of Adaku when they were children. An instance of how parts of mythology pop up in everyday life has to do with the days of the week. Aside from Sunday and Monday, each day of the week is named after a god or goddess, usually from Roman mythology, which is closely related to Greek mythology. Myths also connect and develop into complex systems, like political movements, over time, which means that myths connect the past to the future. Myths are like a culture's past memories that are being relived in the present, while it sheds light on the future. <p>&nbsp;</p>In addition, myths have evolved over time. Myths, incredibly, are still relevant today mostly because ancient writers crafted them to be up to individual interpretation while still using timeless ideas and themes. For example, hope from Pandora's box lives within each person, and is a timeless idea because everyone, regardless of when or where they live, or their gender and age, needs hope to get through life. Giving credit where it is due, a lot of myths are still admired and appreciated today because of their revival in popular culture. An example of this is the author Rick Riordan, who writes middle-grade books that include a lot of Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and Norse mythology, and through this has brought a new, younger generation into the world of mythology. <p>&nbsp;</p>Myths are humanity's universal language, and through the similarities, people can connect, even on a global level, while through inidivudal differences, diversity can be celebrated and each culture prserved in the special differences of every tale.</p>
